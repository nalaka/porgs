## Design

Overall design goals:
- **Simple for end-user**: At all times the system should present just what the user needs.
- **Simple for developers**: The whole system should be understandable by just one person.
- **Simple to extend**: System should consist of the base, a required core plugin, and optional feature plugins.
- **Simple to deploy**: System should be deployable as a single binary with zero external dependencies.

## Product

**Background**: The initial requirements for the product are driven by the first client,
a large government organization in Sri Lanka. The organization has a large number of 
employees and a high rate of inter-branch transfers. However, PORGS is being designed 
from the get go to be broadly applicable to other government and community organizations.
