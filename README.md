## Design

Overall design goals:
- **Simple to use**: The system should always present only what the user needs.
- **Simple to develop**: The entire system should be understandable by a single person.
- **Simple to maintain**: The system should deploy as a single binary with no external dependencies.
- **Simple to extend**: Features should be implemented as plugins atop a core system that handles essentials,
 integrating plugins for additional functionality.


## Product

**Background**: The initial requirements for the product are driven by the first client,
a large government organization in Sri Lanka. This organization features a significant
number of employees and a frequent rate of inter-branch transfers. However, PORGS is being
designed from the outset to be widely applicable to other government and community organizations.
